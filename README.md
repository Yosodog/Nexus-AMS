## üöÄ About Nexus AMS
Nexus AMS (Alliance Management System) is an open-source web application designed for managing alliances in the game **Politics & War**. It provides powerful tools for alliance banking, war management, resource tracking, taxation, loans, recruitment, and more. It is intended to be a successor of BK Net, which is over 10 years old at this point, and be fully on par with features.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha Warning
This project is currently in **Alpha** and is **not** production-ready. Expect breaking changes, incomplete features, and potential security risks. Use at your own risk!

## üí° Why PHP and Laravel?
Nexus AMS is built using **PHP 8.3+** and **Laravel**, leveraging the framework‚Äôs robustness, scalability, and ease of development. Don't hate on PHP/Laravel, it's the best tool for this job. Fight me.

## üåç About the Node.js Project (Nexus AMS Subs)
[Nexus AMS Subs](https://github.com/Yosodog/Nexus-AMS-Subs) is a companion **Node.js** service that listens to **Politics & War GraphQL subscriptions** and forwards real-time updates to the Nexus AMS backend. It ensures live updates for nation data, alliances, and wars, etc, reducing the need for constant API polling.

### How it Works:
1. **Node.js Service:** Listens for live events from Politics & War using GraphQL Subscriptions.
2. **Pusher Integration:** Manages real-time updates.
3. **API Service:** Forwards updates to Nexus AMS.

## üõ†Ô∏è How Nexus AMS Works
Nexus AMS is structured to be modular and scalable:

### Key Features (In current state):
- **Alliance Banking:** Manage deposits, withdrawals, and transactions securely.
- **Loans:** Manage loans and interest payments.
- **City Grants:** Send and manage city grants.

This application is supposed to help you manage your alliance, so expect a fully-fledged system eventually.

### Alliance membership helper
Many features need to know whether a nation belongs to "our" alliance group. Always resolve
`AllianceMembershipService` instead of reading `PW_ALLIANCE_ID` directly:

```php
$membership = app(\App\Services\AllianceMembershipService::class);

if ($membership->contains($nation->alliance_id)) {
    // Treat this nation as part of our umbrella, including enabled offshores.
}
```

The service merges the primary alliance ID with every enabled offshore and caches the result. When an offshore
is toggled or its alliance changes, the membership cache is refreshed automatically.

### Tech Stack:
- **Backend:** Laravel (PHP 8.3+)
- **Frontend:** Blade with Tailwind CSS (DaisyUI)
- **Database:** MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **Subscriptions:** Node.js + GraphQL
- **Admin Panel:** AdminLTE (Bootstrap 5)
